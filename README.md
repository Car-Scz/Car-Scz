- 👋 Hi, I’m Carol Schultz a.k.a. @Car-Scz.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development and am expanding my tool set of knowledge and skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and C# as I work through sample projects provided in technical books or ones I've found on the internet.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on providing documentation research and updates. I see a gap in that area since the last thing techies usually want to do is document.
- 📫 I can be reached at carschul24@gmail.com.
